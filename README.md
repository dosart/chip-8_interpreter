A Chip-8 emulator written in modern C++.

[Chip-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) is a simple, interpreted, programming language which was first used on some do-it-yourself computer systems in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  
Our CHIP-8 system is the [Telmac 1800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telmac_1800). Weâ€™ve got ourselves a pool of 4K of memory, a 64x32 1-bit display, and the ability to beep. The CHIP-8 interpreter itself is implemented via a virtual machine. We keep track of a stack, sixteen 8-bit registers (named V0 through VF), a 12-bit index register (named I), a program counter, two 8-bit timers, and a 16-frame stack.

## Motivation

This is a project to write a Chip-8 emulator in modern C++. The main motivation is to learn lower level programming concepts.

Here are some of the concepts I learned while writing this program:

- The base system: specifically base 2 (binary), base 10 (decimal), base 16 (hexadecimal), how they interact with each other and the concept of abstract numbers in programming
- Bits, nibbles, bytes, ASCII encoding, and big and little endian values
- Bitwise operators - AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), left shift (`<<`), right shift (`>>`) and how to use them for masking, setting, and testing values
- The concept of a raw data buffer and how to work with it, how to convert an 8-bit buffer to a 16-bit big endian array
- How a CPU can utilize memory, stack, program counters, stack pointers, memory addresses, and registers
- How a CPU implements fetch, decode, and execute
